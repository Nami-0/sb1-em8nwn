In the specific places/landmark

Put an error whenever user input a destination that does not correlate with the places or landmarks.
Example: if user choose Japan but choose the landmarks of eiffel tower that are no way located in Paris, put an error and unable to generate the itenrary

To implement this feature, we'll need to perform a validation check when the user submits the form. Specifically, we will compare the destination chosen with the specific locations or landmarks to ensure consistency. If there is a mismatch, we should display an error message and prevent itinerary generation. Here's how we can achieve this:

Update the Validation Logic in views.py:

Add a new validation check before generating the itinerary. This will involve comparing the selected destination with a list of valid landmarks or places corresponding to that destination.

Define Valid Locations for Each Destination:

Create a dictionary or similar data structure to map each destination to its valid landmarks or places.

Here's how you can implement these changes:

# views.py
@main_views.route('/itinerary', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def itinerary_form():
    form = ItineraryForm()
    openai_api_available = is_openai_available()
    # Dictionary to map destinations to valid specific locations/landmarks
    valid_locations = {
        'japan': ['Tokyo Tower', 'Mount Fuji', 'Kyoto Temple'],
        'france': ['Eiffel Tower', 'Louvre Museum', 'Notre Dame Cathedral'],
        # Add other destinations and their valid locations here
    }
    if form.validate_on_submit():
        selected_destination = form.destinations.data
        selected_locations = form.specific_locations.data.strip().split(',')
        # Validate that the selected specific locations match the destination
        if selected_destination in valid_locations:
            for location in selected_locations:
                if location.strip() not in valid_locations[selected_destination]:
                    flash(f'The location "{location.strip()}" is not valid for the selected destination "{selected_destination}".', 'danger')
                    return redirect(url_for('main_views.itinerary_form'))
        if not openai_api_available:
            flash('Cannot generate itinerary at this time. The service is temporarily unavailable.', 'danger')
            return redirect(url_for('main_views.itinerary_form'))
        
        # Add exception handling and itinerary generation logic here
        try:
            if not form.travel_focus.data:
                flash('Please select at least one travel focus.', 'danger')
                return redirect(url_for('main_views.itinerary_form'))
            
            content = generate_itinerary(form)
            # Database saving logic here
            return render_template('itinerary_result.html', itinerary=itinerary)
        except Exception as e:
            flash(str(e), 'danger')
            return redirect(url_for('main_views.itinerary_form'))
            
    return render_template('itinerary_form.html', form=form, openai_api_available=openai_api_available)
Key Points:
Validation Logic: We use a dictionary valid_locations to map each destination to its allowed places/landmarks. We then perform a check to see if each provided specific location is valid for the chosen destination.
Feedback to User: If a mismatch is found, we flash an error message to the user and redirect them back to the itinerary form.
This logic will ensure that users specify only those locations which are appropriate for their selected destination, helping maintain the relevance and accuracy of generated itineraries.
